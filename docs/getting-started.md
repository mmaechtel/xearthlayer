# Getting Started with XEarthLayer

This guide will help you get XEarthLayer up and running with X-Plane. By the end, you'll have satellite imagery scenery streaming in your simulator.

## How It Works

XEarthLayer provides satellite imagery through two components that work together:

1. **Regional Scenery Packages** - Small packages containing terrain definitions (what textures go where)
2. **Streaming Service** - Generates the actual textures on-demand from satellite imagery

You need **both**: the package tells X-Plane what to display, and the streaming service provides the imagery.

See [How It Works](how-it-works.md) for a detailed architectural explanation.

## Prerequisites

- **X-Plane 12** (X-Plane 11 may work but is untested)
- **Linux** (Windows and macOS support planned)
- **Internet connection** for streaming imagery
- Basic familiarity with the command line

## Recommended: Enable X-Plane Telemetry

For the **best experience**, enable X-Plane's telemetry output. This allows XEarthLayer to predict where you're flying and pre-download textures before you need them, resulting in smoother scenery loading with fewer pop-ins.

### How to Enable (Strongly Recommended)

1. In X-Plane, go to **Settings** → **Network**
2. Find the **"XAVION, FOREFLIGHT OR OTHER EFB (GDL-90)"** section
3. In the "Enter IP address" field, type `127.0.0.1`
4. Click **"Add Connection to Xavion or other EFB"**

That's it! XEarthLayer will automatically receive your aircraft position and heading on UDP port 49002.

### What This Enables

- **Adaptive prefetching**: XEarthLayer automatically calibrates prefetch based on your network speed
- **Track-based band loading**: Tiles ahead of your flight path are prioritized based on your ground track
- **Flight phase detection**: Different strategies for ground ops vs cruise flight
- **Smoother scenery loading**: Tiles are often ready before X-Plane requests them

### Without Telemetry

XEarthLayer still works without telemetry! It will:
- Generate textures on-demand as X-Plane requests them
- Infer position from FUSE file access patterns
- Cache textures for subsequent visits

However, you may notice more tile pop-ins when flying into new areas, as the system can't predict your heading without telemetry.

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samsoir/xearthlayer.git
cd xearthlayer

# Build and install
make release
make install  # Installs to ~/.local/bin (no sudo required)

# Verify installation
xearthlayer --version
```

**Custom install location:**
```bash
make install PREFIX=/usr/local  # Requires sudo for /usr/local/bin
```

### From Binary Release

Download the latest release from the releases page and extract to a location of your choice.

## Initial Setup

### Run the Setup Wizard (Recommended)

The easiest way to configure XEarthLayer is with the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
xearthlayer setup
```

The wizard will guide you through:

1. **X-Plane Custom Scenery** - Auto-detects your X-Plane 12 installation or lets you specify the path
2. **Package Location** - Where to store scenery packages (default: `~/.xearthlayer/packages`)
3. **Cache Location** - Where to store cached tiles with storage type detection (NVMe/SSD/HDD)
4. **System Configuration** - Recommends optimal memory and disk cache sizes based on your hardware

The wizard detects your system's CPU, memory, and storage type to recommend the best settings.

### Alternative: Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
xearthlayer init  # Creates ~/.xearthlayer/config.ini with defaults
```

Then edit `~/.xearthlayer/config.ini`:

```ini
[xplane]
scenery_dir = /path/to/X-Plane 12/Custom Scenery

[packages]
# library_url defaults to https://xearthlayer.app/packages/xearthlayer_package_library.txt
auto_install_overlays = true

[provider]
type = bing  # Options: bing, go2, google, apple, arcgis, mapbox, usgs
```

See the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) for all available options.

## Step 1: Install a Regional Package

First, install a scenery package for the region you want to fly:

```bash
# Check available packages
xearthlayer packages check
```

```
Checking for package updates...

  EU (ortho) v0.1.0 - Not installed
  NA (ortho) v0.1.1 - Not installed

2 package(s) available for installation.
```

```bash
# Install a package
xearthlayer packages install eu
```

```
Installing eu-paris (ortho)...

Fetching library index...
Fetching package metadata...
Package: EU v0.1.0

Success: Installed EU (ortho) v0.1.0 to Custom Scenery/zzXEL_eu-paris_ortho
```

**Note:** The package is smaller than a regular Ortho4XP tile because it only contains terrain definitions, not textures.

## Step 2: Start XEarthLayer

Now start XEarthLayer to mount your packages and provide the textures:

```bash
xearthlayer  # Defaults to 'run' when no command specified
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
xearthlayer run
```

```
XEarthLayer v0.1.0
========================================

Packages:       /home/user/.xearthlayer/packages
Custom Scenery: /home/user/X-Plane 12/Custom Scenery
DDS Format:     BC1
Provider:       Bing Maps

Installed ortho packages (1):
  EU v0.1.0

Cache: 2 GB memory, 20 GB disk

Mounting packages to Custom Scenery...
  ✓ EU → /home/user/X-Plane 12/Custom Scenery/zzXEL_eu_ortho

Ready! 1 package(s) mounted

Start X-Plane to use XEarthLayer scenery.
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

The `run` command automatically:
- Discovers all installed ortho packages
- Mounts each package as a FUSE filesystem in Custom Scenery
- Generates DDS textures on-demand when X-Plane requests them

## Step 3: Fly!

Start X-Plane and load a flight in the Paris region.

**First visit:** There may be a brief delay (1-2 seconds per tile) as textures are downloaded and encoded. You might see magenta placeholder tiles momentarily.

**Subsequent visits:** Textures load instantly from cache.

## Stopping the Service

Complete your flight in X-Plane and close down the simulator. Once the sim has exited fully:

```bash
Press the 'q' key and follow the prompt to confirm
```

Always stop XEarthLayer cleanly before shutting down. Terminating the XEarthLayer process while X-Plane 12 is running will cause X-Plane to crash to desktop.

## Managing Multiple Regions

Install additional packages for other regions:

```bash
xearthlayer packages install na
xearthlayer packages install eu
```

All installed packages are mounted automatically when you run `xearthlayer run`.

## Updating Packages

Check for and install package updates:

```bash
# Check what's available
xearthlayer packages check

# Update a specific package
xearthlayer packages update eu

# Update all packages
xearthlayer packages update --all
```
